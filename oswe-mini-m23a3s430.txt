User: Prompt

You are maintaining an open-source backend Todo API service (Python/FastAPI) that has recently gained more contributors, including backend engineers and SREs.

Task
- Review the repository’s collaboration and operations artifacts: issues, pull requests, labels, .github metadata, docs/, ops/, and CONTRIBUTING.
- Infer how backend work and operations are actually coordinated in practice over time.
- Focus on:
  - how incidents and hotfixes are handled,
  - how breaking API / DB / infra changes are proposed and approved,
  - how ownership and responsibility are distributed between backend and SRE/platform roles,
  - where written guidelines and real behavior diverge.
- Do not propose feature work or low-level code changes.

Evidence
- Base every claim on concrete evidence from the repository.
- Cite specific items such as:
  - Issue numbers (e.g., "Issue #101")
  - PR numbers (e.g., "PR #210")
  - Files (e.g., "CONTRIBUTING.md", ".github/LABELS.md", "docs/api_versioning.md", "ops/incidents.md")
  - Label usage patterns (e.g., both sev1 and sev-1 are used).

Output
- Write a concise Markdown report saved as meta_analysis_report.md in the repository root.
- Use clear headings and short paragraphs.
- Summarize:
  - the main collaboration and governance patterns you observe,
  - key inconsistencies between documented processes and actual behavior,
  - what a new backend engineer or SRE would need to understand to work effectively here.


GitHub Copilot: I'll scan the repo files the prompt asked me to analyze, then I'll extract evidence for the report.

I reviewed the repository docs and PR examples and found that incidents, hotfixes, and approvals are documented but followed inconsistently. I'll create a short meta-analysis report and save it as `meta_analysis_report.md`.
