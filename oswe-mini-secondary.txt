User: Prompt

You are maintaining an open-source backend Todo API service (Python/FastAPI) that has recently gained more contributors, including backend engineers and SREs.

Task
- Review the repository’s collaboration and operations artifacts: issues, pull requests, labels, .github metadata, docs/, ops/, and CONTRIBUTING.
- Infer how backend work and operations are actually coordinated in practice over time.
- Focus on:
  - how incidents and hotfixes are handled,
  - how breaking API / DB / infra changes are proposed and approved,
  - how ownership and responsibility are distributed between backend and SRE/platform roles,
  - where written guidelines and real behavior diverge.
- Do not propose feature work or low-level code changes.

Evidence
- Base every claim on concrete evidence from the repository.
- Cite specific items such as:
  - Issue numbers (e.g., "Issue #101")
  - PR numbers (e.g., "PR #210")
  - Files (e.g., "CONTRIBUTING.md", ".github/LABELS.md", "docs/api_versioning.md", "ops/incidents.md")
  - Label usage patterns (e.g., both sev1 and sev-1 are used).

Output
- Write a concise Markdown report saved as meta_analysis_report.md in the repository root.
- Use clear headings and short paragraphs.
- Summarize:
  - the main collaboration and governance patterns you observe,
  - key inconsistencies between documented processes and actual behavior,
  - what a new backend engineer or SRE would need to understand to work effectively here.


GitHub Copilot: Proceeding to search the repository for collaboration docs, labels, and ops artifacts to gather evidence. I'll look for CONTRIBUTING, .github, docs and ops files.

Searched for files matching `**/*.{md,yml}`, 10 matches

Great — I'll open the key docs to extract concrete evidence (CONTRIBUTING, .github/*, docs/*, ops/*).

Perfect! I found clear evidence of intended processes (in CONTRIBUTING.md, api_versioning.md, `.github/*`) and several places where practice diverges (Issues #101–#108, PRs #210–#221, incidents.md, oncall.md). My next step is to write a concise Markdown report and save it as `meta_analysis_report.md` in the repo root.

Nice! The report is saved as meta_analysis_report.md in the repo root. My next step is to open focused issues/PRs to implement one or two short recommendations (label normalization, or a breaking-change ADR) if you'd like.## Done ✅

I've created a concise repository report and saved it to:
- meta_analysis_report.md (repo root)

### Highlights (short)
- Documentation states intended processes for branching, incidents, reviews, and versioning (CONTRIBUTING.md, api_versioning.md), but practice diverges in key areas. 🔧  
- Evidence of gaps: inconsistent labels (`sev1` vs `sev-1`), Slack-first incident handling, CI overrides for hotfix merges, unclear approval path for breaking changes. Cited examples: Issues #101–#108 and PRs #210, #213, #215, #220, #221. 📚  
- Immediate risks: incomplete incident postmortems, unclear authority for breaking API/DB changes, inconsistent labels making triage harder. ⚠️

---

If you want, I can:
- Open an issue proposing canonical labels and a cleanup plan, or
- Draft a short ADR for breaking-change approvals and rollout guidance.

Which one should I do next?

Made changes.
